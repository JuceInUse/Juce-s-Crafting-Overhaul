v1.0.1

Technical Changes
          •  Changed Mod ID to match datapack name
                    ◦  "juces_crafting_overhaul" instead of "juces_recipe_overhaul"


Redid Vanilla Recipes
          •  Trapdoors now yield 12, matching the conversion rate of slabs
                    ◦  Iron trapdoors produce 8 as to match this rate

          •  Paper recipe is now shapeless, so it no longer requires a crafting table

          •  Redstone torches yield 4, matching the non-redstone counterpart

          •  Sticks now yield 16, so their conversion rate doesn't match slabs

          •  Sticks From Bamboo now yield 4, matching the original recipe for sticks


Bug Fixes
          •  Piston and Flipped Piston recipe are now grouped in the recipe book

          •  White Terracotta redying now works the same as the rest of the redying

          •  Removed old "jams_smp" tag from some recipe groups
