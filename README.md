# Juce's Crafting Overhaul
An extensive crafting datapack made to ENHANCE recipes, not make new ones

Currently, Juce's Crafting Overhaul consists of 470 recipe files! I aim to slowly increase this number as time goes on, making an extremely large set of options for the players. If certain features get more love than others, I may also split certain features into their own datapacks

Due to the extensive list of recipes, I have opted instead to list them in the wiki rather than in here! [Check out the wiki]([url](https://github.com/JuceInUse/Juce-s-Crafting-Overhaul/wiki)https://github.com/JuceInUse/Juce-s-Crafting-Overhaul/wiki) for more information!
